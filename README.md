# Next 13 template

This is a _super minimal_ starter for Next 13's App Router.

Not intended for use in production. Purely used for educational reasons.

## Running a development server

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then, start a local development server:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

**Note:** Unlike create-react-app, we need to run the `dev` command, not `start`. The `start` command is used to run a _production_ server; we'll learn more about that later in the course.

## Troubleshooting

- Please make sure you're using Node.js version 16.14 or higher. This is the minimum Node version required by Next.js.
  - You can find your current Node version by running `node -v` in a terminal. If the value is less than 16.14, you'll want to upgrade Node to the [current LTS (Long Term Support) version](https://nodejs.org/en).
